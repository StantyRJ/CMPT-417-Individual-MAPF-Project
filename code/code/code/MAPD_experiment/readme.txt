Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) Simulation
This framework evaluates MAPD pathfinding solvers and scheduling strategies in a grid world.

Setup
Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
Map File: Place your map instance (instance_basic_01.txt) in the root directory.

Running the Project: executes three experiments (Agent Scaling, Task Rate, Solver Comparison)
python mapd_simulation.py
or
python3 mapd_simulation.py

Generate Plots: Reads the JSON file and creates performance graphs
python mapd_simulation.py
